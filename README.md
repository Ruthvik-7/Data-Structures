# Data Structures

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures. These data structures are fundamental concepts that form the foundation for solving complex problems in computer science. The following data structures are included in this repository:

## Data Structures Included:

1. **Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)** - A collection of nodes where each node points to the next, with variations including doubly linked lists and circular linked lists.
2. **Stack (Using Arrays/Linked List)** - A collection of elements with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, implemented using arrays or linked lists.
3. **Queue (Circular Queue, Priority Queue)** - A collection of elements with First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, with variations such as circular queues and priority queues.
4. **Binary Tree** - A tree structure where each node has at most two children.
5. **Binary Search Tree (BST)** - A binary tree where each node’s left child has a value smaller than the node’s value, and the right child has a value larger.
6. **Hash Table** - A data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows fast access using a hash function.
